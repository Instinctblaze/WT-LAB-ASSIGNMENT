<h1>Inheritance in Java</h1>
<p id="x1"><b>Inheritance in Java</b> is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).</p>
<p id="x1">Inheritance represents the <b> IS-A relationship</b> which is also known as a parent-child relationship.</p>
<p id="x2">Why use inheritance in java<p>
<ul id="x1">
<li>For Method Overriding </li>
<li>For Code Reusability.</li>
</ul>
<p id="x2">Terms used in Inheritance<p>
<ul id="x1">
<li>
<p><b>Class:</b> A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sub Class/Child Class:</b> Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.<p></li>
<li><p><b>Super Class/Parent Class:</b> Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Reusability:</b> As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.</p></li>
</ul>
