<h1><u>METHOD OVER-RIDING IN JAVA</u></h1>
<p id="x1">If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as <strong> method overriding in Java.</strong></p>
<p id="x1">In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding. <p>
<p id="x2"><u>Usage of Java Method Over-riding</u></p>
<div class="code">
<ul>
  <li>Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.</li>
  <li>Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h1>Rules for Java Method Over-riding</h1>
<div class="code">
<ol>
  <li>The method must have the same name as in the parent class.</li>
  <li>The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.</li>
  <li>There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).</li>
</ol>
